# Directional Light and Shadows

How to use a directional light to make shadows.
Adapted from
[Three.js How To Tutorial - Shadows](http://danni-three.blogspot.com/2013/09/threejs-shadows.html).

The original check-in, and the tutorial it's based on,
also includes an example of how to do shadows
with a spotlight (both lights at the same time)
which is a useful technique, but of course not correct for astronomy.
