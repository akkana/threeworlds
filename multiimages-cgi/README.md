This version only uses three.js to wrap rectangular images around a globe.
The images are generated by a Python script (which could be run as
a CGI), located in ../python/daynightimage.py, that finds the time
of the next solstice or equinox and generates a sequence of
rectangular maps showing the progression of the terminator.

Spacebar advances the terminator to the next image. You can rotate
the globe in 3D by dragging the mouse, or with the arrow keys.

This approach generates the prettiest images of all the tests in this
repo: I haven't found a way (yet?) in three.js to show both day and
night images and still get a blurred terminator between them.

The Python approach also has the advantage that it can use
[PyEphem](https://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/index.html)
to find the actual dates of sunrise, sunset, solstices and equinoxes;
there's no equivalent JavaScript library, so that would all have to
be written from scratch if it doesn't come from Python.

On the other hand, since the images are statically generated, there's
no question of being able to advance the terminator manually, or
dynamically change the latitude/longitude being viewed;
you can drag the globe around manually but you can't do anything
to change the terminator position except by advancing to the
next static image. It also takes quite a while to generate each
new set of images.
