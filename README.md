# ThreeWorlds

Fiddling with displaying Earth, and maybe other planets, in
various ways in [Three.js](https://threejs.org).

I have one previous Three.js project in another repository:
[MarsMap} in [webapps](https://github.com/akkana/threeworlds)
(see the [live MarsMap page](https://shallowsky.com/marsmap/)).
